Instructions:

You have to add the sprite to wl_act1
{SPR_TOXWASTE,bo_toxic},                  //toxic waste
Then add a case
case    bo_toxic:
and then add bo_toxic to wl_def.h
In wl_def.h, you add it to the Global Types section

Code:

case    bo_toxic:
            if(gamestate.health <= 1)
            {
                HealSelf (-gamestate.health);
                StartDamageFlash (1);
                playstate = ex_died;
            }
            else
            HealSelf (-1);
            StartDamageFlash (1);
            return;
